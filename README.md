RollAbility puts a twist to the ever popular genre of platformers. Players must roll for different movement controls (abilities) to use as they traverse the mossy cave and save their lost slime friend!

Abilities include:
 - Jump - Regular platformer controls
 - Sling - Angry Bird-like slinging controls
 - Flap - Flappy Bird-like controls
